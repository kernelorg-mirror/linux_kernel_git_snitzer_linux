# AGENTS.md

Direction for AI agents (and humans) working in this tree on the branches
`kernel-7.1/hs-7.1.13-5.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY` and
`kernel-7.1.13/main.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY`.

## Branch workflow

- **`kernel-7.1.13/main.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY`** carries the series on the
  public `kernel-7.1.13/main`, rebased 2026-09-25 onto **`v7.1.13-14`** (35
  commits: the LOCALIO post-op-attrs fix is in that tag, and a standalone
  `nfs_common: fix the skip accounting in nfs_dio_iter_aligned()` leads the
  branch). On `-14` the write
  split lives in `fs/nfs_common/nfs_dio.c` (`nfs_dio_split()`, shared with
  NFS LOCALIO), so the immutable-bvec and gate commits change that file, not
  `fs/nfsd/vfs.c`; see `../NFS_LOCALIO_DONTCACHE/`. The `v7.1.13-12` version
  is kept as `kernel-7.1.13/main.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY.v7.1.13-12`. It was
  the same 35 commits on `v7.1.13-12`
  instead of the Hammerspace DP stack. The two branches differ only in the
  base adaptations recorded as `[snitzer: …]` notes; a change made on one
  must be carried to the other.
- **`kernel-7.1/hs-7.1.13-5.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY` is the current branch**
  (since 2026-09-18): the page-loan series, regrouped into contiguous logical
  sections, on top of `kernel-7.1/hs-7.1.13-5` — which already carries the
  Hammerspace DP downstream stack, so there is no separate integration branch
  to keep in sync any more. Do all development and all `*.md` edits here,
  as **incremental commits at the tip**; fold/regroup only when Mike asks for
  a cleanup (history is rebased then, so don't rely on stable SHAs).
- The earlier branches — `kernel-7.1.8/main-5.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY`
  (development, on `v7.1.8-5`), `kernel-7.1/hs-7.1.8-5.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY`
  (its Hammerspace integration branch), `kernel-7.1/hs-7.1.8-3.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY`
  and `kernel-7.1.8/main.NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY` (the raw incremental history)
  — are **history**; dated narratives in the docs still name them.

## NFSD TCP write-path zero-copy (page-loan series)

The server-side page-loan work — eliminating the redundant receive-side data
copy on the NFS write path — has its own directory:

- **[`NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/README.md`](NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/README.md)** —
  the canonical overview: the problem and measurements, David Flynn's page-loan
  design, the two branches and how they relate, the 30-commit series structure
  and provenance, the Hammerspace-base adaptations (`[snitzer: …]` notes),
  build/bisect-test instructions, and Xsight E1 NIC hardware context.
- **[`NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/PROJECT.md`](NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/PROJECT.md)** —
  deep technical notes: the code path with references, the alignment analysis,
  the candidate zero-copy-receive direction and its ranked risks, the full
  Xsight E1 RX-capability findings, and the design decisions behind the
  page-loan integration (including the series' generic mechanism, per-procedure
  opt-in, and ownership contract).
- **[`NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/TESTING.md`](NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/TESTING.md)** —
  how to test: the four KUnit suites (build, run, expected results, the known
  NFSv4.1 replay finding), the runtime validation that shows the copy
  elimination (`io_cache_write=2` + page-aligned writes, tracepoints, flat
  page-cache footprint), and the static QA gates (W=1 / sparse / checkpatch).
- **`NFSD_TCP_WRITE_ZEROCOPY/v7.1.8-3-aarch64-4k.config`** and
  **`…-64k.config`** — the ARM test kernel configs used to verify the series is
  bisect-clean (base + all 30 commits build with zero warnings/errors under
  `CONFIG_WERROR=y`, on both 4K and 64K page sizes, with the KUnit tests built).

Start with the README before touching the series; it explains why each of the
three base-adaptation commits exists and how to reproduce the bisect walk.
